As I'm a golang developer, there is a article that compare between golang and spring.
> [Spring Boot Native vs Go: A performance comparison](https://ignaciosuay.com/spring-boot-native-vs-go-a-performance-comparison/)

The article said "**Golang is 133% faster than Spring**". They run various test to compare performance and it is clear to know the difference in performance! So, I would like to summarize that article in this post.
