# Difference in concept
* Process
  * program that currently running
  > when program in disk load on memory, it become process
* Thread
  * basic unit of CPU to execute task
  * **process contains one or more threads**

# Difference in structure
* Process has Code, Data, Stack, Heap, PCB(ID, state, PC, memory limits, Register, priority, files, etc.)
* Thread has Stack, TCB(ID, state, PC, SP, Register, etc.)

# Multithread in Golang
This case is when you run **Golang executable files** with three go-routines which is user-level thread.

And these OS kernel thread is matched with goroutine(user-level thread) with this features

**To get more information about goroutine, please check my last posting here**

Back to the subject, Users can manage their process with Goruntime or Thread-libraries. And how about OS level?

They manage their process with above lifecylce
