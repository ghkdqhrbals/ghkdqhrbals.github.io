# Design rules for restful URI
* URI needs to show information of resource
  * resource should be **nouns** rather than verbs, **lowercase** letters rather than uppercase letters
  > ex) `GET /Members/show/1 -> GET /members/1`   (verbs -> nouns, uppercase -> lowercase)
  * Server's directory name should be plural nouns
  * Client's storage name should be plural nouns
  > ex) `GET /Member/1 -> GET /members/1`
* URI should not show act on resources
> ex) `GET /members/delete/1 -> DELETE /members/1`     
> ex) `GET /members/insert/2 -> POST /members/2`    

* don't use `_` in URI
  > there is a possibility that you cannot see the proper information
* File extensions are not included in the URI
  > ex) `http://restapi.example.com/members/soccer/345/photo.jpg` (**X**)     
  > ex) `GET / members/soccer/345/photo HTTP/1.1 Host: restapi.example.com Accept: image/jpg` (**O**)
