* Direct Mapping
  * Advantage
    * Fast as only tag field matching is required while searching for a word
    * It is comparatively less expensive than associative mapping.
  * Disadvantage
    * high conflict miss rate(lots of replacement)
    > this could be occured when same cache line is used by two or more frequent memory frames.

* Associative Mapping
  * Advantage
    * easy to implement and low hit latency
  * Disadvantage
    * high cost for searching(hit latency)
    > it needs to search every cache if its hit.
    > it could be fine with placing parallel comparator to each cache line, but still high hit-latency than direct mapping

* k-way Set Associative Mapping
  * Advantage
    * can store same modular index up to k, lower conflict miss

**When cache miss occured and needs to write new data, you can write both main memory and cache(Write-through) or write in cache and later write main memory(Write-back)**. And you can upgrade your performance of cahce with locality(spartial, temporal)
