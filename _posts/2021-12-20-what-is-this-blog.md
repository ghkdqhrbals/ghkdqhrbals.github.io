# What is this blog?

Recently, I felt that my programming skill level is low.

> When I was studying for bachelor degree in computer science, I focus programming and CS **theoretically**.   
> When I'm studying now for master degree, I also focus on blockchain and DL/ML knowledge **theoretically**.

That means, my CS knowledge is based on theory, **not on practical solution**.

So I will use this blog as a note to record not only theoretical knowledge but also **PRACTICAL** knowledge.

Banking backend server with Golang series, as the name suggests, will develop a banking backend server and it will be a long journey.

> As purpose of this blog is just for recording, there might be something missing. All posts are just scribbled, so the grammar will be wrong.
