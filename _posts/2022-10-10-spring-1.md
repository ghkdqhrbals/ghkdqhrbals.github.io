## What is Web Application Server?
* Web Application Server
  * Server that processing business logic with DB

## What is Web Server?
* Web Sever
  * performing Load-balancing
  * caching
  * Nginx, Apache are representative Web Server

Originally WAS and Web Server is combined as one big server. But current days, traffic is growing rapidly and also the DB access rate. And here is the problem that big server cannot handle all of traffic. So, engineers seperate big server into two server, i.e. WAS and Web Server. By seperating into difference space, we can get advantages below.

* First, **we can get high scalabilty**. We only need additional entry point and server to scale up server. Because WAS can automatically balance(Round Robin, etc.) the traffics by just adding additional server's entry point.
* Second, **we can reduce load of repetitive Client's requests**. Because the Web Server can caching Client's requests(HTML, CSS, etc. files), so that prevent from heavy load on business logic in WAS.
> Web Server can caching static HTML, CSS files.

Web Server has two representative frameworks
* Apache
  * Use a thread for each requests
* Nginx
  * Asynchronous event-based handling requests
  > Faster than apache when multiple requests come
