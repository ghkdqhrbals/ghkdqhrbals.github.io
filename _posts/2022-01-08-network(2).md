# Application Layer
* Various protocols exist in the application layer. Among them, **HTTP** is a widely used protocol, and today I will describe it in detail.

# HTTP
* HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a protocol to send and receive data between the browser and the server, so it has become an essential knowledge for developers.
* HTTP is a **stateless** protocol.
  
  What is the stateless meaning of? Here is an example that shows the difference between Stateful and Stateless.  
> #### Stateful   
> Alice : Hey Bob, can i buy a coffee?    
> Bob : which one?    
> Alice : latte plz.   
> Bob : cost will be 2$   
> Alice : here is 2$.   
> Bob : here is latte!   
> 
> #### Stateful
> Alice : Hey Bob, can i buy a coffee?   
> Bob : which one?   
> Alice : latte plz.   
> Bob : cost will be 2$    
> Alice : 2$ for what?   
> Bob : for latte.   
> Alice : how much for latte?   
> Bob : cost will be 2$.   
> Alice : 2$ for what?   
> Bob : ...   

  In this example, Alice is a **server** and Bob is a **client**. Alice don't remember the state that Bob said. So **Bob should remember the cost of latte**(this job will be charged at client's **Cookie**) and say **"I want latte and here is 2 dollars"**. Stateless will help server to reduce the load and to improve scalability.
  
> But not everything can be designed stateless. Even if you simply look at the **LOGIN**, the server must maintain the logged-in state of the user. In this case, the state is maintained using browser cookies or server sessions.

  HTTP has been changed a lot since 1990.
