# Main difference between Docker and VM
* Size
  * VM : large size
  > To execute program, VM needs to have GuestOS which is very large size
  * Docker : small size
  > Docker needs only bin/lib files which is compact size

* Speed
  * VM : slow 
  > For example, when I/O occurs, VM needs to transfer the I/O from the GuestOS into HostOS, and transform to HostOS I/O driver   
  * Docker : fast
  > Docker container share its kernel with host OS, so doesn't need to transform it

* lifecycle(Portability)
  * VM : complicate
  > for example, just in case you want to upgrade the version of your program. With VM, you need to pull from registry, update all configuration files, reset environments, etc. So it is very hard to change or update your program    
  * Docker : easy
  > Docker can simplify this process. Download image, run it!

> Thus, with Docker, you can easily scale out your app. And this is a basic skill that lead you to make your service with Micro Architecture Service!
