# How UNIXv6 manage their memory

Definition of process is "**Instance of a program in execution**". And in UNIXv6, they manage 


![a](../../assets/p/cs/os/memory_unix6.png)
* Code : store program code
* Data : store global & static variable, heap
  * local static variable : its data is located in memory until the program exit, but can be only accessed inside the function
  * global static variable : its also located in memory, and also can be accessed outside the function. But not outside the program.
* User Stack : store arguments, local variable, etc.
* User : store process information(file location, Registers, etc.)
* Kernel Stack : store system variable
* proc : store **essential** process information which is always located in memory(PID, priority, status, location of program in disk)

And Text & Data segments will be replaced when Context Switch is occured(by I/O interrupt, error, child process, cpu time scheduling, etc.)    
> We will now note `Text + Data segment` as `swappable image` or `process image`.

But in case of that other user access directly to your memory address space that you currently using, how can you handle?

With MMU(Memory management uniut), OS can prevent from misdirection.

MMU's can gives you 3 advantage

### MMU's 3 advantage

* **Protection**
  * prevent R/W/Jump to other process image in memory
* **Scattered Allocation**
  * process image can be scattered, so user can manage their memory space more efficiently
* **Relocation**
  * when using memory, you can swap image

> Scattered Allocation could be **trade-off comparing to Contignous Allocation**     
> In Contignous Allocation, it is more easy to check memory protection fault    
> But nowadays, we use paging tech. in memory. **Thus rather Contignous Allocation, Scattered Allocation is used in current days**

UNIXv6's MMU don't use `TLB` and `Page Table`, but `APR` for their translation between VA(Virtual Address) to PA(Physical Address)
